## Typescript module boilerplate

A Typescript module boilerplate that utilises Jest, eslint and prettier.

### Global modules

The module requires the following npm modules available - I install them globally to efficiently share them
between modules:

```
npm i -g coveralls prettier rimraf ts-node tslint tslint-config-prettier typescript
```
